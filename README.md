Currently a student at The Knowledge House, I come with a background rooted in product design and photography. However, my journey has led me to a newfound passion for cybersecurity. With a diverse array of skills at my disposal, I am excited to leverage my creativity, problem-solving abilities, and keen eye for detail to transition into the dynamic field of cybersecurity.

## Objective

Aspiring to become a skilled Security Analyst, I'm focused on mastering essential tools crucial for safeguarding digital assets. I'm dedicated to learning SIEM platforms like Splunk and Wazuh, network monitoring tools such as Wireshark, and intrusion detection systems like Snort. My goal is to contribute to proactive threat detection, incident response, and overall cybersecurity resilience.
